# Stream Processing

Assumption for batch processing: the input is bounded, i.e., of a known and finite size, so the batch process knows when finished reading input. For example, sorting that is central to MapReduce. It could happen that the last input record is the lowest key and needs to be the very first output record. Starting the output early is not an option.

In reality, a lot of data is unbounded because it arrives gradually over time. Thus, batch processors must artificially divide the data into chunks of fixed duration: for example, processing a day’s worth of data at the end of every day.

To reduce the delay for daily batch processing, we can run processing more frequently--say, every second--or even continuously. This is the idea befind stream processing.

In general, a “stream” refers to data that is incrementally made available over time. The concept appears in many places: in the stdin and stdout of Unix, programming languages (lazy lists: infinite streaming, lazy evaluation, e.g. Haskell `is.tl` and `is.take`, Python `generators`(`yield`)), filesystem APIs (such as Java’s FileInputStream), TCP con‐ nections, delivering audio and video over the internet, and so on.

## 11.1 Transmitting Event Streams

In both streaming and batch processing worlds, input data essentially is a small, self contained, immutable object containing the details of something that happened at some point in time. The input data could be a file for batch processing and an event for streaming.

In a filesystem, a filename identifies a set of related records; in a streaming system, related events are usually grouped together into a topic or stream.

Moving toward continual processing with low delays, polling becomes expensive if datastore is not designed for this kind of usage. The more often you poll, the lower the percentage of  new events, and thus the higher overheads. Instead, it is better for consumers to be notified when new events appear.

Databases have traditionally not supported notification mechanism well: relational databases commonly have triggers, which can react to a change (e.g., a row being inserted into a table), but they are very limited in what they can do and have been an afterthought in database design. Instead, specialized tools have been developed for event notifications.
