# Twitter

Ruby on rails.

In 2013 [1], Twitter now has 150M worldwide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines, and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow through the system, and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from Lady Gagaâ€™s fingers to her 31 million followers.
